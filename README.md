ultrasound-processing
=====================

This repository contains several processing scripts/documentation for ultrasound data

###Contents:
* extractaudio.py is used for batch processing audio extraction from ultrasound video.
* extractframes.py is used for batch-processing frame extraction from ultrasound video.
* conconcatenate.py concatenates .con files generated by Edgetrak

------------------------------------------------------------------

The scripts extractframes.py and extractaudio.py assume that you have python and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) installed on your computer.

* [Windows installation instructions](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)
* To install on a Mac:
  - [Download](http://ffmpegmac.net/)
  - Place the ffmpeg directory somewhere your computer can find it. One option is moving the ffmpeg directory to /usr/local/bin which you can do by running `sudo cp -r path/to/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`.

concontateate.py works with the output of Edgetrak
